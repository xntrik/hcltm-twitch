Christian has no idea what he's doing.

But, let's have a little look at:
- Threat modelling
- What hcltm is
- How to get started


He also doesn't know how to put together a background screen - so he's just going to type stuff into vim.

Things covered:
- Briefly covered hcltm
- Drafted a bit of a vending machine DFD (tons of stuff missing)
- Show a simple dashboard (more to show here ;P)
- <3
